# docker-compose-brython

Since I didn't find a suitable example quickly, I built one myself. Tested with Docker version 18.06.1-ce-mac73 (26764), channel: stable, b0f14f1dac, Compose: 1.22.0

## Trying out

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Open http://localhost:8001/ and/or http://localhost:8001/demo.html in your browser.

```
docker-compose down
```
